# Robotics

- use my 7in pi LCD and create an animated robot head moved by some RC servos (left/right, up/down)
- develop an AX12 ardino interface to a computer
    - from boot, send setup file: {number servos, {servo1, max, min}, ..., {servoN, max, min}}
    - simple serial interface to move servos: {s0:angle,speed, ..., sN:angle,speed}
- arduino AHRS (madwig, mahoney) with matrix lib
    - output quaternion
        - mahoney: gyro and accel
        - madwig: gyro, accel, and mag
        - ahrs: accel and mag
    - from boot, sent calibration values for sensors
    - from boot, determine type of orientation filter
    - turn on/off calibration
- **RANGER:** arduino controlled RC car interface
    - [Ranger repo](https://github.com/MomsFriendlyRobotCompany/ranger)
    - ESC control
    - Steering control
    - feedback
        - current speed setting and direction
        - current (amps)
        - other sensors?
- **mjolnir**: 3d camera
    - [mjolnir](https://github.com/MomsFriendlyRobotCompany/mjolnir)
- apriltag calibration target
    - targets, selectable which tag
    - plexi 6x6 or 4x6 encased targets using 16h5 targets
    - backlit? coat back with shiny material (aluminum foil?) to reflect light?
    - printed frame?
        - maybe just 1 pane of plexi covering printout and back is printed plastic?
        - 1 pane makes printing easier?
    - anti-glare cover?
    - mounting point for tripod or other
    - accel orienataion with wifi/bt or lcd orientation (roll/pitch)
        - qypi $6, lsm6ds33 $6, lcd ?
        - external usb power
